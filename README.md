# White Blood Cells Type Classification

Identification of human blood is very important to know before any blood transfusion. In emergency situations, if the blood group is not identified exactly, it causes many problems to the patient and may become fatal. Generally, the blood group is identified manually by the lab technicians performing blood tests. 

In this project we will use supervised learning process to classify white blood cells using convolutional neuronal networks (CNN), our dataset was extracted from Kaggle, containing four white cells subclasses on a total of 12,000 images
